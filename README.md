How-to :

(ubuntu)
java -jar fitnesse-standalone.jar -p 8080
(where 8080 is the port on which you want to open FitNesse, 80 being default and being already in use)

You can then access FitNesse  on localhost:8080 in your browser.

Three tests are available at the bottom of the main page (feel free to experiment on FrontPage.TestApplication, the last test is supposed to return true but returns false)
